## Interview Solution

ðŸ‘€ Solution code for search application for cross_platform using [flutter](https://flutter.dev/).
The final app looks like this:

#### LIGHT THEME

| Landing                    | Search for user repos         | Non existing user search       | 
|----------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![Landing](images/one.png) | ![User repos](images/two.png) | ![Non-users](images/three.png) | 

#### DARK THEME

| Landing                         | Search for user repos              | Non existing user search          |  
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ![Landing](images/dark_one.png) | ![User repos](images/dark_two.png) | ![Non-users](images/dark_two.png) |

### Prerequisites

- Before running this app, you need to have java 19 installed:

- Ensure the minimum sdk set above 21 and multiDexEnabled set to true on app/build.gradle:

```shell script
    defaultConfig {
        minSdk = 23
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
```

- Ensure the compile sdk is set to 34:

```shell script
    android {
    compileSdk = 34
```

- Once the project is set up, run:

```
    flutter pub get
```

### Background

The data will be provided by the following API -> https://api.github.com/

endpoint to use: https://api.github.com/users/{user}/repos{?type,page,per_page,sort}
The application would have only 1 screen - Repository search screen

### Requirements:

Repository search screen should have a search bar on the top, repositories should be searched by
itâ€™s owner account username

    1. Each row should display username, avatar, and repository name.
    2. The list should be paginated, use â€˜pageâ€™ and â€˜per_pageâ€™ API endpoint query params.
    3. Implement error and loading states.
    4. Use your preferred best practices.
    5. Share solution via Github.
